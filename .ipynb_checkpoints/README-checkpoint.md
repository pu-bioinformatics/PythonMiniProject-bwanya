# PythonMiniProject
Mini-project for the Python for Biologist class at Pwani University

The PDB File Analyser program prompts a user to enter a valid PDB file. The entire program is composed of different functions that process the entered PDB file according to the user's choice. For example, if a user wants to see the secondary structure of a protein, they would choose option 4 which would print the protein's secondary structure.
The data folder contains the downloaded PDB file. The export function exports the results of the Information function to a txt file in the Results folder. 
The script folder holds a script for running the PDB File Analyzer program.
